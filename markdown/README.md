# Workshop 4

## Paragraphs
Consistently recognized as one of Canada’s top universities, Trent University is home to a dynamic community of scholars embodying our motto nunc cognosco ex parte – now I know in part – valuing what has been learned, and what is yet to be discovered.

Attracting excellent students from across the country and around the world, Trent is known for leadership in teaching, research, and student satisfaction. Here, students connect and collaborate with faculty, staff, and their peers through diverse communities that span our unique collegiate communities, disciplines, hands-on research, co-op and career experience, and community-based activities.

Across all disciplines, Trent brings critical, integrative thinking to life every day. Popular among students is Trent’s uniquely flexible learning environment where a single faculty of arts and science allows students to fully customize their degree in a way that truly reflects their goals and interests.

Trent University offers students the opportunity to study in more than 100 programs across two campuses. The Peterborough campus features award-winning architecture and innovative and academically-rigorous programs housed on 1,400 acres in a breathtaking natural setting on the banks of the Otonabee River. A second campus, Trent Durham Greater Toronto Area, is located in Oshawa and offers career-ready academic programs and experiences. A new residence and academic building opened at this growing campus in Fall 2020.
